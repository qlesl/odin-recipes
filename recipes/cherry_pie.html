    <h3>Bursting with juicy cherries and baked to perfection in a flaky, 
        golden crust, Classic Cherry Pie is a dessert lover’s dream. This 
        pie combines the sweet-tart flavor of ripe cherries with a hint of 
        vanilla and almond, creating a filling that’s thick, glossy, and 
        bursting with flavor. Wrapped in a buttery, homemade crust that’s 
        either beautifully latticed or fully covered with golden pastry, it’s 
        the ultimate comfort dessert. Whether served warm with a scoop of vanilla 
        ice cream or enjoyed on its own, this cherry pie is a timeless favorite 
        that’s perfect for any occasion!</h3>
        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <p><em>For the Pie Crust:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups (315g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup (225g) unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6-8 tablespoons ice water</li>
        </ul>
        <em>For the Cherry Filling:</em>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups fresh or frozen cherries, pitted</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (150g) sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (30g) cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, cubed</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Instructions:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Pie Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, and salt. Add cold, cubed 
                butter and use a pastry cutter (or your fingers) to work the butter into the flour 
                until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon 
                at a time, mixing just until the dough comes together. Divide the dough into two disks, 
                wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Cherry Filling:</strong> In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the cherries, sugar, cornstarch, 
                lemon juice, vanilla extract, and almond extract (if using). Stir continuously until the mixture 
                thickens and becomes glossy, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out one dough disk on a floured surface to fit a 9-inch 
                pie pan. Place the dough into the pan and trim the edges. Add the cherry filling and dot the top with small pieces of butter.</li>
            <li><strong>Top the Pie:</strong> Roll out the second dough disk and either cover the pie completely, cutting small vents for steam to escape, or cut the 
                dough into strips to create a lattice top. Trim and crimp the edges to seal the pie.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the Pie:</strong> Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. If the edges of the crust 
                brown too quickly, cover them with foil.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Let the pie cool for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the filling to set. Enjoy your cherry 
                pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream!</li>
          </ol>
