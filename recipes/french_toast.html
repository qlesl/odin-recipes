    <h3>Start your morning with a warm and comforting plate 
        of Classic French Toast. Each slice of thick bread 
        is soaked in a rich mixture of eggs, milk, vanilla, 
        and a hint of cinnamon, then cooked to golden perfection 
        with a crispy exterior and soft, fluffy center. This easy 
        breakfast favorite can be topped with sweet maple syrup, 
        a dusting of powdered sugar, or fresh fruit for a delicious 
        and customizable treat. Perfect for a cozy weekend brunch or 
        a quick weekday pick-me-up, French toast is a timeless dish 
        that always satisfies!</h3>
    <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices of thick bread (preferably brioche or challah)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter (for cooking)</li>
        <li>Maple syrup, powdered sugar, or fresh fruit (for serving)</li>
      </ul>
    <strong>Instructions:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Whisk the Batter:</strong> In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, 
            cinnamon, sugar (if using), and a pinch of salt until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Soak the Bread:</strong> Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and add a little butter. 
            Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, ensuring both sides are well coated. Let the bread 
            soak for a few seconds to absorb the mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the French Toast:</strong> Place the soaked bread slices on the hot skillet and cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, 
            until golden brown and slightly crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve your French toast warm, topped with maple syrup, a sprinkle of powdered sugar, or fresh fruit like berries or banana slices.</li>
      </ol>
